<h2> Our Objective:</h2>
<center><div class = "show">
<p>We decided to make a website that gives further insight on the hands-on projects that we each individually
  created for the purpose of revealing what is taught behind the closed doors of the Girls Who Code Summer
  Immersion program over the course of our seven weeks!</p>
</div></center>
<h2>About Us:</h2>
<div class = "Imani">
  <h1>Imani:</h1>
  <div class = "info">
    <p>My name is Imani Hernandez, a seventeen-year rising senior from Miami, Florida. I am currently in a coding
   program, learning to code so I am capable of doing something different, something
  not many girls my age can do or are introduced to. I have been various places
  across the world including Jamaica, Haiti, Bahamas, Mexico and Africa, where
  stayed for about a two-week long period. My family consists of two brothers and
  one sister and me, the middle child. My father is from Nicaragua and my mother from
  the United States.</p>

<div class = "Kenadie">
  <h1>Kenadie:</h2>
    <div class = "info">
    <p>My name is Kenadie Singleton, and I am 17 and a senior at
    Grand Prairie Fine Arts Academy. I enjoy sewing and art and wish to pursue
    a career in animation and cartoon production and to hopefully create my
    own web series. I thoroughly enjoy video games, cartoons, and webcomics, as well as anime.
    These games, shows, and comics have really influenced me in my art and storytelling style,
    and my decision to pursue art more seriously.</p>
