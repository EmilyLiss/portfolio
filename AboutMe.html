    <div id = "about">
      <h3>My name is Emily Liss. I am a 16 years old junior at Flower Mound High School in Flower Mound Texas.
        At FMHS, I am a member of the colorguard in our state recognized marching band. I am a black belt in Taekwondo, a
        certified lifeguard, babysitter, tutor, and volunteer through my church. I have been programming for three years
        (2014) and I am very passionate about it. I love the puzzle aspect of it, how you need to make everything fit togther
        for it to work. I currently know HTML, CSS, Java, PHP, python, and javascript. I am hardworking, caring, and good at
        balancing my school work and extracurricular activies. I wish to pursue a career and major in computer science.
